There are quite a lot of people I admire but the person I admire the most is my mom. My mom is very pretty and she cares a lot about me, which is why I admire her the most.
                     My mom is tall and has black hair. She has dark brown eyes. My mom has a very decent and friendly personality.
                      Being selfless is a great quality that my mom has because whenever I am sick she stays up all night to look after me. She sacrifices her own needs for my requirements. My mom is also very protective about me. She gives away all her pleasures for my sake and wants me to be happy all the time.
                       My mom does a lot of hard work with me with my school's work because she dreams of me being the top student in my class. She also cooks the best food for me.
                       My first and best teacher and guardian is also my mom because she taught me when I was small and still teaches me and works very hard with me. She corrects me where I am wrong and also scolds me sometimes for my betterment. She is very understanding and knows everything in and out of me. There is no generation gap between me and my mother. My mom is also the best friend I ever had.
                       My mom does not have many habits. She is very good at doing Arts and also has some interest in designing clothes. She also loves cooking and baking things with me and my brother.
                            I love my mom very much and she also loves me. Ten maids cannot even do as much work as my mom does. Mostly every woman can be a mom but it takes a lot of courage and hard work to be like my mom.
